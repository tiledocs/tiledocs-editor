# TileDocs Issue Tracker

This repository is dedicated to tracking user-reported issues, feature requests, and suggestions for TileDocs. 

It is not the source code repository for TileDocs, as the project is not open-source.

How to use this repository:

* Check existing issues to see if your concern has already been reported.
* Create a new issue for bugs, feature requests, or general suggestions.
* Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and address your feedback.

We appreciate your input and look forward to improving TileDocs with your help!
